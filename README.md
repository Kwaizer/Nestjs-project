## Hands-on backend project using `TS` and `Nestjs` as framework to play around with user's authentication and `Nest`'s functionality itself.
Here is implemented:
- adding users
- adding users' roles
- distribution of app's functionality depending on the user's role
- user's authentication and registration
- ability to ban users
- postgres connection and management
- file and post uploading
  
P.S. Docker containerization is on its way!
